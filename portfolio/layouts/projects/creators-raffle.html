                <p>“Creator’s Raffle” is a made-up movie where a shipyard worker is told he’s won the opportunity to become
                a “Creator,” in which a random person from an eligible universe gets the chance to create their own
                universe. This movie would fall into categories that other stories such as “A Wrinkle in Time” and
                Studio Ghibli Productions would. The beautiful surrealism of giant glowing goldfish swimming through the
                sky, as well as the humble environment of a shipyard combine to communicate the feeling of wonder in an
                average and unassuming place. Aiding in that, the 1-point perspective creates a tunnel for the viewers
                eyes to delve into which mimic the all enveloping awe the character in the scene would be feeling.

                <p>This piece was made using a picture I took of a vase with flowers in it. The vase was actually a
                    repurposed daiquiri cup and the flowers are white and red carnations. Symbolically, red carnations
                    represent love, and white carnations are good luck. The combination of the two helps to add depth to
                    the poster’s meaning by symbolizing both the love for nature and urban environments and the wish for
                    luck in our endeavor towards uniting the two. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the challenges of making the piece was how to get all elements– the building, cityscape, and
                    type– to look as though they belonged in the same image instead of separate item layered on top of
                    each other. To do this I employed a couple techniques. One of which was weaving the text through the
                    plants so they appeared to be interacting. I also gave the text a glowing affect like the flower
                    building and used a typeface that had a rough texture with some see through parts. This allowed the
                    backdrop to become more integrated through the text as well as having the same texture as concrete
                    walls you would see in an urban environment. Finally layered a texture over the whole image to unify
                    the piece and add more grunginess that can be associated with major cities.

                <h3 style="color: #DA1E51; font-weight: normal; font-size: 3rem;">Outcome</h3>
                <p>The final poster was one of six pieces from the College of San Mateo that were featured alongside
                    other posters in the Seeding the City International Exhibition. It is visually captivating and
                    successfully conveys the idea of blending nature with the urban landscape. It received positive
                    feedback for its unique and thought-provoking design, igniting conversations about the importance of
                    having hope for the future of the environment and ourselves.

        <p>The final logo and business card effectively communicated the intended ideas. I’ve received much feedback
          from peers who said they’ve greatly enjoyed my branding noting it as “unique, colorful, and passionate.” The
          unique design often sparks conversation and leaves a lasting impression, enhancing my professional networking
          efforts.</p>
