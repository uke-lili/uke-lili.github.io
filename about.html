        <p>Function and beauty have always been at the forefront of my creative process. Before I even knew that these
          were fundamentals of design, I was trying to achieve them. I wanted my art to have a purpose. Being a pretty
          picture is a valid enough purpose but I’m the type who feels bad about buying things that’ll only sit
          somewhere. Design allows something to do more than just sit there. That something can communicate and connect.
        </p>
        <p>I use vibrant colors, clean lines, and whimsical imagery– all to communicate who I am and how I am connected
          with the world. I try to bring out the colors I feel when I think of the imagery I illustrate as well as
          including elements (although not entirely realistic) that remind me of what the image feels like. I often
          think of artists like Marian Bantjes, David Carson, and Mike Perry. Boiled down, it's trying to balance what
          it is and what it feels like.</p>
